## Prerequisites

- Ensure Rust is installed on your machine. If not, you can install it using `rustup`.

## Setup

### Create a New Project

To create a new Rust project, run:

```bash
cargo new my_project
cd my_project
```
## Project Structure
Here's a brief overview of the project's structure:

```
.
├── src
│   ├── main.rs
├── Cargo.toml
├── .gitignore
└── README.md

```

- `src/main.rs`: The main source file where the execution starts.
- `Cargo.toml`: The configuration file for Rust's package manager, Cargo.

## Example Code

Add the following code to `src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}

```

## Building and Running

To build and run the project:
```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```
